# Project 5: Neighborhood Map
A responsive web application using the **Knockout** web framework to mark several attractions in Seattle, WA on a map. Users have the ability to search by attractions on a collapsible sidebar and **Google Maps API** will display markers of the filtered list of places. Clicking on an attraction will open an information window and display a photo of the selected place using the **Flickr API**. This is the fifth project assignment from [Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree).
