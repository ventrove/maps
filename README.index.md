# Project 5: Neighborhood Map
A responsive web application using the **Knockout** web framework to mark several attractions in Seattle, WA on a map. Users can search by attractions on a collapsible sidebar and **Google Maps API** will display markers of the filtered list of places. Clicking on an attraction will open an information window featuring the name, category, and number of check-ins using the **Foursquare API**. This is the fifth project assignment from [Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree).
